# Tasks sync server

Single-user synchronization server for HamsterBase Tasks. It is written in Go,
stores opaque CRDT changes in PostgreSQL, and uses one bearer token for
authentication.

## Run locally

```bash
AUTH_TOKEN='replace-with-a-long-random-token' \
DATABASE_URL='postgres://tasks:password@127.0.0.1:5432/tasks?sslmode=disable' \
ADDRESS=':8400' \
go run ./cmd/tasks-server
```

Configuration:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_TOKEN` | required | Single-user bearer token |
| `DATABASE_URL` | required | PostgreSQL connection URL |
| `ADDRESS` | `:8400` | HTTP listen address |
| `STATIC_DIR` | empty | Vite build directory to serve |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` | Allowed web origin |

## Docker Compose

The canonical `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` live in the repository root. The
image contains both the Vite web app and this Go API, while Compose starts that
image together with PostgreSQL and RustFS. PostgreSQL stores task sync changes,
while RustFS stores attachment objects through its S3-compatible API.

Create `.env` in the repository root:

```dotenv
AUTH_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-token
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-database-password
RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY=replace-with-a-rustfs-access-key
RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret-key
RUSTFS_SERVER_ACCESS_KEY=replace-with-a-server-access-key
RUSTFS_SERVER_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-different-long-random-secret-key
```

From the repository root, start the web app, API, PostgreSQL, and RustFS:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

For local development, start only PostgreSQL with Docker and run the Go API
directly from this directory:

```bash
# server/
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev-password docker compose up -d postgres

# server/
AUTH_TOKEN=dev-token \
DATABASE_URL='postgres://tasks:dev-password@127.0.0.1:5432/tasks?sslmode=disable' \
CORS_ORIGIN='http://localhost:4000' \
go run ./cmd/tasks-server
```

PostgreSQL is exposed on `127.0.0.1:5432` by default for local debugging:

```bash
psql 'postgres://tasks:replace-with-a-database-password@127.0.0.1:5432/tasks'
```

To connect from another machine, explicitly set `POSTGRES_BIND=0.0.0.0` and
protect port 5432 with a firewall or private network. Do not expose PostgreSQL
directly to the public internet.

Useful tables:

- `spaces`: sync folders and current revisions
- `changes`: immutable Loro changes
- `snapshots`: compacted Loro snapshots
- `clients`: device sync cursors

## Attachment storage

The Compose stack starts RustFS on its internal port `9000` and creates the
`tasks-attachments` bucket automatically. The S3 port is not published to the
host. Its management console listens on the host loopback interface on port
`9001` by default.

When a Tasks client connects to the self-hosted sync server, it automatically
detects attachment support through the authenticated
`GET /api/v1/attachments/config` endpoint. Existing clients migrate on their
next startup. A manually configured third-party S3 service is not overwritten.

Clients upload and download through the Tasks API using the existing bearer
token. The Go server streams objects to and from RustFS over the private Docker
network. The initialization container creates a RustFS user restricted to the
attachment bucket; neither that credential nor the administrator credential is
ever sent to clients.

For production, expose only the Tasks API over HTTPS and restrict `CORS_ORIGIN`
to the deployed Web origin. RustFS does not require a public endpoint or browser
CORS configuration.

## API

All space endpoints require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>
```

- `GET /api/v1/health`
- `GET /api/v1/attachments/config`
- `PUT /api/v1/attachments/objects/{key...}`
- `GET /api/v1/attachments/objects/{key...}`
- `GET /api/v1/spaces/{space}/status`
- `GET /api/v1/spaces/{space}/changes?after=0&clientId=<id>`
- `GET /api/v1/spaces/{space}/events?clientId=<id>`
- `POST /api/v1/spaces/{space}/changes`
- `PUT /api/v1/spaces/{space}/snapshot`

Payloads are base64-encoded Loro changes or snapshots. The server deliberately
does not interpret CRDT contents. The events endpoint is an authenticated SSE
stream that emits committed revision numbers and excludes revisions uploaded by
the subscribing client. It sends a heartbeat every 25 seconds; reverse proxies
must allow streaming responses and disable response buffering for this route.
Space names are trimmed and normalized to lowercase, making them
case-insensitive across every sync endpoint.
